title: CCA Dynamics
---

This is the website for the Dynamics Group at the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics">Center for Computational Astrophysics</a> (CCA) at the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/">Flatiron Institute</a> in New York City.

The Dynamics Group explores how collective dynamics driven by gravitational interactions shape structures — planets, stars and galaxies — in the universe. This topic sits at the crossroads between large observed and simulated datasets that describe these structures in the real and model universe.

- Join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/ccadynamics">CCA Dynamics mailing list</a> to receive info about how to join our group meetings.
