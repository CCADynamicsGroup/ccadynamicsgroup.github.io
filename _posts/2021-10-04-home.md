The <a

Dynamics Group</a> at the <a
href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics">Center
for Computational Astrophysics</a> (CCA) explores how structures in the universe, such
as dark matter and stellar halos, galaxy disks, and satellite galaxies and streams, are
shaped by gravitational interactions and collective dynamics.

Join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/ccadynamics">CCA Dynamics mailing list</a> to receive info about how to join our monthly public group meetings (on the second Thursday of each month).
