title: Galactic Dynamics at the CCA
---


The <a
href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/dynamics/">Galactic
Dynamics Group</a> at the <a
href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics">Center
for Computational Astrophysics</a> (CCA) explores how structures in the universe, such
as dark matter and stellar halos, galaxy disks, and satellite galaxies and streams, are
shaped by gravitational interactions and collective dynamics.
Our work has a particular focus on <i>dynamical disequilibrium</i>, where we use theory,
numerical simulations, and data analysis to studying the impact of mergers and
time-dependent internal dynamical processes on the evolution of galaxies and the Milky
Way.
Our group makes heavy use of astrometric and stellar data from the <a
href=https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia"><i>Gaia</i> Mission</a> and the <a
href="https://www.sdss.org/">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a> (APOGEE and SDSS-V surveys).

mailing list</a> to receive info about how to join our monthly public group meetings.
